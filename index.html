            <h1>Tropical Fruits of Indonesia: The Visitor's Must-Try List</h1>
            <p>Posted by London B.</p>
         <p>Indonesia is a beautifully diverse and multifaceted nation. With over 700 languages and distinct ethnic groups, 
            Indonesia has an enchanting culture of unity in diversity. Variety is one word that can describe 
            almost any aspect of Indonesia. Not only are the people, languages, and cultures they represent highly diverse, 
            but the nature that exists there is even quite diverse as well, including the selection of locally grown fruits. 
            What follows is a summary of my top tropical fruit recommendations to try for those who are visiting Indonesia. Each one of these is 
            sure to provide a memorable experience!

            alt = "durian fruit" style="width:500px;">
               <p>The word <em>durian</em> is derived from the Malay word for &quot;thorns&quot;. 
               And by looking at it, it is easy to see why it has been named the 
               &quot;thorny fruit&quot;. In my opinion, a durian just looks like something a person should not eat.
               Other than the intimidating thorny outer shell, it also has a very 
               stinky smell, that can be smelled from far away. In Indonesia, there are even
               airlines that will not allow passengers to bring durian on-board the plane
               due to its smell. I have tasted durian before and I did not like it very much.
               The fruit has a slimey, custardy texture to it. But people from Medan, Indonesia 
               not only like durian, they love it. It has become almost a part of their identity, 
               having a reputation around Indonesia for being durian lovers. Even though I did not 
               like it when I tried it, I still would recommend that if you are ever in Indonesia,
               make an effort to get your hands on some durian. The experience is one to remember!</p>

               alt = "passion fruit" style = "width:500px;">
               <p>One fruit that I enjoyed while in Indonesia was <em>markisa</em>, which 
               is the Indonesian word for &quot;passion fruit&quot;. At times we would drive up into the mountains 
               and they always had the best markisa there. You can buy it in bundles by the kilogram, 
               tear it open with your hands, and scoop out the interior with a spoon to enjoy a delicious,
               unique citrus flavor that is (when ripened to perfection) a little sweet.</p>

               alt="dragon fruit" style="width: 500px">
               <p>Dragon fruit, or <em>buah naga</em>, is originally from the Americas, but it is very commonly grown in Indonesia.
               I associate it with Indonesia as well. It grows on a cactus plant, and the fruit inside 
               can be either red or white. The two colors of fruit taste similar enough to one another, and 
               the texture of the fruit is similar to the texture of kiwi fruit. However it is also a little 
               bit crunchy because of all of the little black seeds in it. If you are going to eat red dragon 
               fruit (my personal favorite), you will want to be sure and not get the fruit on your clothes 
               because it will stain very easily.</p>

               alt="jackfruit" style="width: 500px">
               <p>Jackfruit, or <em>nangka</em>, grows plentifully on trees in Indonesia. Even driving through town, you will 
               many times be able to see the tall jackfruit trees with the massive 35-40 lb jackfruit hanging from them.
               For me, I was always a little bit anxious to stand too close to those trees, out of fear that a 
               fruit would fall and hit me on the head! My fear was validated when an Indonesian colleague of mine 
               confirmed that it is not unheard of for a person to be injured by a jackfruit falling. </p>

               <p>Jackfruit is a versitale fruit. The unripened green fruit and seeds can be cooked in savory dishes, And
               some vegetarians even like to use it as a meat substitute. My favorite form of jackfruit is when it is
               added to a curry and served with a traditional Padang dish called <em>rendang</em> as well as rice, vegetables, 
               and a spicy sauce commonly served with Indonesian dishes called <em>sambal</em>. When cooked this way, 
               jackfruit has a stringy texture (kind of like meat), and a more neutral flavor that will absorb the flavor
               of the dish it is being cooked in. I've actually never tried the ripened, yellow jackfruit, but I have heard 
               that it has a sweeter flavor than the less ripe green fruit.</p>

               <p><em>Rambutan</em> is known as the &quot;hairy fruit&quot; as its name is derived from the Malay word for &quot;hair&quot;. To eat rambutan, you 
               can peel off the hairy rind by hand and then enjoy the white fruit that is inside. Rambutan fruit has a pit inside 
               that you can either eat around or spit out when you are finished. It is very easy to open and eat. It has a flavor 
               similar to a pear mixed with a grape flavor. The texture of the fruit is soft and easy to chew.</p>

            alt="snake fruit" style="width:500px">
               <p>Tropical fruits are no joke! Whether they are highly potetnt like durian, giant like jackfruit, or brightly colored like
               rambutan and dragon fruit, the one thing they all have in common is how intense they are! Snake fruit, called 
               <em>salak</em> in Indonesian, is no exception, and it is given the name &quot;snake fruit&quot; for reasons that you will probably 
               be able to guess with one look at the picture below. That's right, the skin of a snake fruit looks and feels very similar 
               to snake skin! Snake fruit also has a pit that you don't eat. It is hard to describe 
               the way snake fruit tastes. The best word I can think of is &quot;tropical&quot;, kind of a mix of sweet and citrusy like pineapple 
               blended with apple or banana. Some salak are more on the sweet side but some are more sour flavors, depending on the variety.</p>

            alt="Star Fruit" style="width:500px">
               <p>Star fruit holds a special place in my heart because it was one of the first Indonesian words that my one year old learned 
               when we first moved to Indonesia. The Indonesian word for &quot;star fruit&quot; is <em>belimbing</em>, and it is so cute to hear a little 
               <em>bule</em> (white) boy saying &quot;<em>belimbing</em>, <em>belimbing</em>!&quot;. Indonesians loved it so much when my kids would try to speak their language. Star 
               fruit actually looks like a star when it is sliced. The fruit itself is kind of firm like the fruit of a grape but star fruit 
               tastes more like a ripe pear than a grape, to me at least.</p>

               <p>For me, when in Indonesia, the really exotic fruits were fun to try. However, my go-to fruit option for my family was papaya 
               served with <em>jeruk nipis</em> (lime). The way the flavors of the ripe papaya and the local limes interact with 
               one another is nothing less than perfection. This was a favorite for my kids too! To them, it tastes like candy. </p>
